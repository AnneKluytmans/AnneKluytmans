👋 Hi, I’m Anne (@AnneKluytmans)!  
I’m a Software Development student at NOVI Hogeschool in Utrecht, the Netherlands.

👀 I’m interested in bringing creativity to life — whether it’s through coding, cooking, or crafting something entirely new.

🌱 Currently, I’m mastering full-stack software development, turning ideas into functional, beautiful applications. My main focus is on HTML/CSS, React, JavaScript, Java and SpringBoot, but I love exploring new technologies.

✨ Projects I’m proud of so far:
- **MealMatch**: A frontend app to inspire people with delicious recipes.
- **Groovify**: A RESTful WebAPI for a vinyl shop—my first steps into building APIs!

🍃 Outside of coding, you’ll find me in nature, hanging out with my dog, or in the kitchen cooking & baking (and especially enjoying the results afterwards!).

⚡ Fun fact: I believe the best debugging happens on walks in the woods — nature never forgets a semicolon.
