#👋 Hi, I’m Anne (@AnneKluytmans)!  
I’m a Software Development student at NOVI Hogeschool in Utrecht, the Netherlands - with a love for creative problem solving and turning ideas into code.

👀 I’m interested in bringing creativity to life — whether it’s through coding, cooking, or crafting something entirely new.

🌱 Currently, I’m mastering full-stack development, focusing on HTML/CSS, JavaScript, React, Java and Spring Boot. I enjoy building user-friendly frontends and diving into backend logic — always looking for ways to combine functionality with thoughtful design.

✨ **Projects I’m proud of:**
- **MealMatch**: A frontend app to inspire people with delicious recipes.
- **Groovify**: A RESTful WebAPI for a vinyl shop—my first steps into building APIs!

🍃 Outside of coding, you’ll find me in nature, hanging out with my dog, or in the kitchen cooking & baking (and especially enjoying the results afterwards!).

⚡ Fun fact: I believe the best debugging happens on walks in the woods — nature never forgets a semicolon.
